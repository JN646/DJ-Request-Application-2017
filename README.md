# DJ Request Application 2017
This application has been rebuilt to a new specification. This new redesigned version should be able to handle the following:
* Client and Session handling.
* Song upload and CSV support.
* User management.
* Pinned requests.
* Allocation of physical zones to devices.

The application is designed to be deployed to clubs and bars and allow the client machines to request songs. The list of songs will be provided by the DJ at the start of each session. Once a song list has been uploaded, the client machines will be able to request their choices to the DJ in their zone. The DJs will be able to approve or pin the requests as they come in.
